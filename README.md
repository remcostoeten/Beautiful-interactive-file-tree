## Beautiful interactive file-tree viewer

In my pursuit of creating beautiful open source components that help with showcasing parsed data or documentation I, nailed it with this epic component. After having build this [beatiful code block](https://beautiful-code-block.remcostoeten.com), and the nice <small>beta</small> api/prop/interface renderer I built this interactive file tree with showcase of the file on click.

It's beautiful, feature-rich and easy to use. There is an pythhon script which you just can run and generates the entire file structure + file contents in `.ts` whihch then is accepted via a prop, and et voila.

```shell
pop-os% python src/scripts/generate-tree-object.py src/app
Successfully generated IDE structure in src/core/config/tree-object.ts
```

Beta and docs to be continued.See landing page for a live demo and props usage. [beautiful-tree.remcostoeten.com](beautiful-tree.remcostoeten.com)
